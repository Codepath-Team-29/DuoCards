## App Overview

### Description 

**Duo cards is an app that combines the gamification of duolingo with the study habits of the flashcard app Anki!** This app will 
login to your Duolingo app and grab all the words that you have learned and create flashcards for them! Gone are the time 
of manually having to input a new card everytime you learn a new word. Let this app do the work for you!

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

   - **Category:** Social Networking / Learning
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for ease of use and access. Most users would just want a quick peek at their and other peers progress, instead of having to login and view it. It would also be easier to just learn from your phone.
   - **Story:** Fuels the competitive nature of learners to continue learning their language. 
   - **Market:** Any user who already has a duolingo account will be able to use this app. 
   - **Habit:** Users are using this daily to check their ranking and to continue to learn cards that they've forgotten. 
   - **Scope:** V1 would be a basic interface of a users duolingo profile and the current words that they have already memorized. V2, users would be able to see their friends progress.
